# 📘 Ecosystem for LibreOffice & SDLC

Welcome to my open knowledge ecosystem, where I document the evolution of tools, ideas, and insights around LibreOffice and software development.

This site serves as:
- a public **journal** for daily discoveries,
- a **framework** for structured chapters,
- a **bridge** for LinkedIn, Patreon, YouTube stories.

> 🌿 Live learning. Shared openly. Evolving consciously.
