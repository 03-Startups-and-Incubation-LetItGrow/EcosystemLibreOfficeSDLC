# ðŸ“… 2025-05-18 â€“ Kickoff & OOODEV Setup

Today marks the official start of the LetItGrow digital chronicle.  
I registered the domain, configured GitHub Pages, and began outlining this framework.

## ðŸ§ª Focus
- Testing OOODEV on Windows
- Preparing the notebook structure
- Clarifying scope (public vs. structured outputs)

## ðŸ“Œ Notes
- Decided to separate **chronicle** (daily log) and **chapters** (final outputs)
- Markdown-based, version-controlled, minimal
